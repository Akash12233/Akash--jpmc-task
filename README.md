**JPMC Virtual Task: Data Visualization with React App**


**Task Description:**
Participants are provided with a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing a dataset with various data points. The goal of the task is to create a dynamic web application using React.js that reads and processes the data from the CSV file and presents it in the form of interactive graphs and visualizations.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Parsing and Processing:** Participants are required to write code to parse and process the data from the provided CSV file. This could involve converting the data into suitable data structures and organizing it for visualization.

2. **Visualization Components:** Using React.js, participants need to develop interactive components that can render different types of graphs such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, or pie charts. Each type of graph should be capable of visualizing specific aspects of the data.

3. **User Interaction:** The React app should allow users to interact with the visualizations. For instance, users might be able to filter the data based on specific criteria, toggle between different types of graphs, zoom in on specific data ranges, or view tooltips for data points.

4. **Styling and Design:** While the primary focus is on functionality, participants are also encouraged to implement a visually appealing design for the app. This involves using CSS or other styling techniques to ensure that the user interface is intuitive, engaging, and easy to navigate.

5. **Responsive Design:** The app should be responsive, ensuring that it works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout and interactions should adapt to different screen sizes.

6. **Code Quality and Best Practices:** Clean, well-organized, and documented code is essential. Following best practices in coding and structuring the React components will be evaluated.

**Benefits:**
Participating in this virtual task provides several benefits:

1. **Skill Demonstration:** Participants can showcase their expertise in data visualization, React.js development, and web design.

2. **Learning Opportunity:** Participants can gain hands-on experience in working with real-world data and implementing interactive web applications.

3. **Networking:** Engaging in the task enables participants to connect with J.P. Morgan representatives and gain insights into the company's work culture and expectations.

4. **Recognition:** Exceptional performance in the task could lead to recognition, potential internships, or future career opportunities with J.P. Morgan.
